# Module 9 - SQL Challenge
## Summary
- As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. I was asked to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s from the six remaining CSV files from the employee database of that period.  I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis on the data.
- But, there was something unusual about the data.
